## Troubleshooting FAQ


### How do I get an Access token Key?

To generate your access token you must first have access to your API key. API Keys are reserved for Enterprise customers. You can retrieve either the API Key or Trial Token by logging in to HeyGen and navigating to this page in your settings: https://app.heygen.com/settings?nav=API. Afterwards you can run the following to obtain your access token.

Please note the tokens are one time use.

```
curl -X POST https://api.heygen.com/v1/streaming.create_token -H "x-api-key: <api-key>"
```

### Which Avatars can I use with this project?

By default, there are several Public Interactive Avatars that can be used. You can find the Avatar IDs for these Avatars by navigating to labs.heygen.com/interactive-avatar and clicking 'Select Avatar'.

You can create your own Interactive Avatar to use with this API by visiting labs.heygen.com/interactive-avatar and clicking 'Create Interactive Avatar' at the bottom of the screen.

### Why am I encountering issues with testing?

Most likely, you are hitting your concurrent session limit. While testing this API with your Trial Token, only 3 concurrent sessions can be created. Please endeavor to close unused sessions with the Close Session endpoint when they are no longer being used; they will automatically close after some minutes.

You can check how many active sessions you have open with the List Sessions endpoint: https://docs.heygen.com/reference/list-sessions
